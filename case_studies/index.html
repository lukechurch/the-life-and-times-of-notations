      <h1>Some case studies</h1>

      <p>
        There are too many notations that are interesting to fit in the main text of the book, but
        the seeing the breadth and difference between them both important to know that the framework
        is general, useful as a source of inspiration for when you have a design problem. Also seeing
        the range of all of the things that people do with notations is one of the most fun parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the content here really depends on the terminology and approach from the rest of the 
        book. Obviously we can't cover that all here, instead we try and have pointers back to the main
        content. There are a few key things you'll need to understand though:

        <ul>
          <li>Notations are not good or bad, only more or less fit for a particular activity and context (REF)</li>
          <li>Notations are not static things, they evolve over time and somewhat predictable lines outlined (REF)</li>
          <li>We use a framework called The Cognitive Dimensions of Notations, or CDs for short, to talk about the properties of notations, a quick summary can be found (REF) or a longer in (REF)</li>
        </ul>

        We don't have any particular point to make in this section, it's just things that we found interesting, and thought perhaps others might.
        This page can live, please feel free to get in touch to suggest another.
        
        We'll break these cases studies up into 3 approximate categories - case studies about particular notations, case studies about mechanisms and everything else.

              Unlike most notations we have mentioned, Causal Loop Diagrams
              (CLDs) describe things that change over time and influence each
              other as they change. They are tools for exploratory
              understanding.

              Knowing what choice to make is often difficult, and if the issues
              are presented unhelpfully, matters will be worse. Whether to take
              an umbrella is hardly a matter of life and death, but many
              situations are just that: dealing with official regulations (eg.
              for displaced persons) or medical guidance (eg. for emergencies)
              are just two examples.
