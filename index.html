      <h1>An anthology of notations</h1>

      <p>
        This website contains short introductions to a variety of different
        notations. Some are illustrations of our thesis about notational
        lifecycles; others are examples of clever design; still others are too
        important to be left out; and yet more - because we liked them for their
        own sake.

              Aerobatics is the art of making an aeroplane dance. We were
              momentarily surprised to discover that there was a formalised
              notation, but of course there is.

              Why we've included this: good example of evolution from iconic to
              abstract and from verbose to succint

            <p class="card-content">
              Unlike most notations we have mentioned, Causal Loop Diagrams
              (CLDs) describe things that change over time and influence each
              other as they change. They are tools for exploratory
              understanding.
            </p>

            <p class="card-footer">
              Why we've included this: good example of sloppy, casual notation,
              with excellent secondary notation; only possible because the
              ontology is weak.

            <p class="card-content">
              Discovering that there has been an error is only half the story:
              what happens next? How easy is it to guess what was indended and
              fix it?
            </p>

            <p class="card-footer">
              Why we've included this: emphasis on transcription and on avoiding
              erros and sometimes reparing them

            <p class="card-content">
              Knowing what choice to make is often difficult, and if the issues
              are presented unhelpfully, matters will be worse. Whether to take
              an umbrella is hardly a matter of life and death, but many
              situations are just that: dealing with official regulations (eg.
              for displaced persons) or medical guidance (eg. for emergencies)
              are just two examples.
            </p>

            <p class="card-footer">
              Why we've included this: we have to cope with conditional
              structures quite often in everyday life, and if you misunderstand
              there are consequences; even more so in programming or other
              formalised situations
